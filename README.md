### Gene Split/Merge Detection Tool

A Python implementation for detecting gene split and merge events between two genome annotations using DIAMOND BLASTP.

**Key Features:**
- Protein alignment with DIAMOND BLASTP
- Bidirectional best hits (BBH) for ortholog identification
- Gene structure analysis to detect splits and merges
- Optional protein clustering with multiple algorithms
